Before sending a pull request its best to ensure the following standards are met.

For our work we like to include tests. In general a pull request will not be merged without a set of PHPUnit tests.

Our coding standards attempt to follow those of Laravel as closely as possible.

We will try and merge your changes as quickly as possible.

Thanks a lot!
