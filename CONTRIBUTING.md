# Contributing

We welcome contributions from outside developers to the Programmes Plant. Before sending a pull request its best to ensure the following standards are met.

As closely as possible we follow the coding standards laid down by the [Laravel core codebase](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) in the 3.0 series.

## Branches

Pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch. `master` is reserved for stable code. 

Branch names should use a "directory" appropriate to the type of change it is: `feature/`, `bug/`, `refactor/`, `tests/` and so on.

## Indentation

- We indent using tabs with a tab width of 4.
