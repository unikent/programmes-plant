# Programmes Plant

Programmes Factory 2.0 is part of the XCRI project at the University of Kent, and is a replacement for the existing Programmes Factory.

It is written in [Laravel](http://laravel.com) and using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

## Development Setup

The following are instructions on running the Programmes Plant on a local machine for development.

1. Clone this repository. Obtain Laravel as a submodule by running `git submodule init`, unless you have done a recursive clone. Note that this app uses the [unikent laravel fork](https://github.com/unikent/laravel.git), because this contains important performance enhancements as yet not pulled into the laravel core. This fork is generally kept up to date with the laravel master branch, so including it as a submodule should give you the latest version of laravel.

2. You need to setup the application by editing all the sample files in `config/` and moving them to `config/local/` filling in as appropriate. To move the files in one command, run:
`mkdir application/config/local && cp application/config/*.sample application/config/local && ls application/config/local/*.sample | while read file; do echo $file  `echo $file | sed s/.sample//`; done`

3. You will need to create a MySQL database if you plan to use MySQL. Create this database and add the credentials to `application/config/local/database.php`.

4. The application requires an authentication driver to be used. The details of this can be setup in `application/config/local/auth.php`. We use our own LDAP driver. If you decide to use our bundled LDAP driver, the server settings can go in `application/config/local/ldap.php`.

5. Programmes Plant uses PHP Session based session driver as a drop in replacement for the Laravel default. This needs to be setup in `application/config/local/session.php` specifying a cookie type.

6. Run `php artisan migrate:install --env=local` to setup the migtations table. Then run `php artisan migrate --env=local` to run all the migrations to setup your database.

7. Copy the public/.htaccess.sample file to public/.htaccess.

8. Point a browser at the public folder.

9. We're done here!

## Testing

Unit tests are written in PHPUnit. To run the tests run `php artisan tests`. The tests use an in memory SQLite database to make them significantly faster.
